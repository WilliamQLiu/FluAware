Android
========

Android code includes:

* Flu Aware is your cheat sheet to learning about the flu quickly. Flu facts and prevention tips are summarized and presented in a fun, easy to understand format. Flu Aware also serves as a resource in finding additional information and services regarding the flu. You're one click away from receiving the latest podcasts or text message updates straight from the CDC.
* HEA (Happily Ever After) is my 'Choose Your Own Adventure' game.  I tried a few different versions of it, some with a JRPG combat system (ala Final Fantasy game series), a text only version, and one with embedded animations/images.  These files that I recovered were from an old hard drive (before I used GitHub) so I'm not sure the state of their completeness.
* HelloworldJava and HelloworldJavaIntermediate are notes and sample programs from the New Boston's Java tutorials.
* LearnAndroid is from my computer science course on Android development combined with the New Boston's Android tutorials.
