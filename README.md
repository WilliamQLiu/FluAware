**Happily Ever After**

A 'Choose Your Own Adventure' game.  I tried a few different versions of it, some with a JRPG combat system (ala Final Fantasy game series), a text only version, and one with embedded animations/images.  These files that I recovered were from an old hard drive (before I used GitHub) so I'm not sure the state of their completeness.
